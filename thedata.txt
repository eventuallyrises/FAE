In Gareth Branwyn's short piece on the fortunate Mr. Magoo as the personification (or cartoonification?)
of mutant progress, he doesn't get into the fact that the codger initially played second fiddle to a bear
who had no lines, yet Magoo was popular enough to get a series of shorts and a few movies, kind of like humans
who have stumbled into their current position, thinking they're the cat's pajamas instead of a series of happy
accidents, in the face of all their (unwitting) efforts to undo their progress at every turn. But overall, still
 an apt stand-in for mutant progress (and if you have only seen this first short, don't worry - Mr. Magoo changes
 from an angry old music-hater to a jolly chap, more in keeping with the happy sort of mutants).
